Contributing

Please read these short instructions before submitting a theme. Submit themes using the "Submit a theme" issue template (do NOT open PRs manually). The project automation will parse your issue and create a PR.

Quick rejection reasons (maintainers will reject or request fixes for):
- Inconsistent or unreadable colors.
- Missing or broken configuration fields.
- Poor contrast or layout issues.
- Not following the required file naming / structure conventions.
- Excessive commented-out code or very large commented blocks in files.

Checklist before opening the issue:
- Paste your final `styles.css` into the `Theme Styles` field (no big commented blocks).
- Paste `config.yaml` into the `Theme Config` field and keep it well formatted.
- Provide a direct PNG link for the preview image in the `Image` field.
- Add a short `Readme` in the `Readme` field.

If a submission is rejected the maintainers will leave a clear comment explaining what to fix; PRs may be closed after 14 days without response.

Thank you for contributing â€” clean, readable themes make the gallery better for everyone.
