# 🎨 YASB Auto-Pywal Theme

A dynamic theme configuration for **YASB (Yet Another Status Bar)** that automatically syncs your bar’s color scheme with your current wallpaper using **Pywal**.

This setup uses a custom **PowerShell wallpaper watcher** to generate a **high-contrast, minimal 3-color palette** (Background · Text · Accent) based on your wallpaper—keeping everything readable and aesthetic.
